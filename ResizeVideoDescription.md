# Suggestions
* Use [Resize YT To Window Size](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/811-resize-yt-to-window-size) for YouTube. It has it's own script since YouTube's website is much more complicated and has many edge cases.
* Experimental support for hiding scrollbar in Firefox v63. Go to `about:config` and set `layout.css.scrollbar-width.enabled` to `true`, then restart Firefox.
